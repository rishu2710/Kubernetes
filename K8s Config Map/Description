Config Map :- 
    It is one of the k8's object which is used to store and manage data which are not sensitive within a cluster.

    It is stored inside etcd db of k8s cluster

    we can provide multiple key and value in data part of the file but key name should be different from each other.

    If a ConfigMap is mounted as a volume, the content is stored temporarily on the node's file system in the location where the container accesses it

Config maps can be used in varios ways :-
        1. key-value pair
        2. confiration file
                So when we create like this it got stored in etcd but when we mentioned this in pod, it is mentioned as volumes which got stored as files inside the containers (/etc/config/config-name)
                It support .properties, .json, or .yaml types 
        3. Command line Argument
        4. Voulme mounts
        5. Binary Data  
                this will be avl in /etc/binary/ directory in pod.
                involves encoding the binary data (like a .zip, .png, or other binary files) into Base64 format before adding it to the ConfigMap
                suppose we have one 
                example.bin binary file
                base64 example.bin > example.bin.b64            enoading in base 64
